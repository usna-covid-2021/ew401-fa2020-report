## Advisor comments to the tea
The team made excellent use of available hardware to test Raspberry Pi, ESP32, and available sensors and actuators. They have progressed further than many other projects reach by capstone day (e.g. Sailbot). 

I would like to see more prototyping of the payload mounting interface. We can approach this in the spring.

In the early phases, I would like to have considered wider ranges of concepts. We never seriously considered a wearable concept or wearable mix. 

Minor comments will be handled via the Latex / Github repository. There are a few typos. The budget should include a disclaimer on the fake labor and overhead numbers which are done only for EW401 training purposes and should never be passed along to a sponsor without a disclaimer. It would help if you could provide your figures etc in the original formats. 

## Advisor comments about EW401
I do not fault the guys for this, but I believe the way EW401 is conducted sets teams up to fail. At other universities (e.g. MIT 2.007, MIT 2.008, and MIT 2.009) the charts and tools are taught within the first few weeks of the sophomore design class (2.007) without much ado. Here they are dragged out, distracting students from actually getting their designs done. These guys needed to be flying and trying stuff in August but could not, partially due to covid, but also in large part due to the design of EW401. 

The format also unacceptably places the 401 instructor and course coordinator and a single customer in the prime position of shaping what the team does. As a result, I have less ability to guide them in the early phases of their project than others, even though ultimately I am the one who will have to help them finish and grade them at the end of capstone EW404. 

The rubrics and templates warp their thinking and should be eliminated. There is a ridiculous 6 page rubric this year - it seeems to grow by a page each year. If I tried to evaluate technical work at Naval Reactors using the course coordinator's 6 page rubric, my section head and ADM Bowman would have thrown a desk across the room. This department does not appreciate how real Navy acquisition professionals work (e.g. Naval Reactors, or the wider Naval Sea Systems Command) but their methods work. When they rename the building for a WRCE prof I will be happy to switch over but last I checked it's still Rickover Hall. 
  * Two "problem statement" headings
  * All criteria graded 0-4 with no actual test data or raw numerics
  * Standards and specifications use I2C and ESD? Really? What value is added by this section? 
  * Fake numbers in budget directed by rubric and templates
  * WBS hours never tied to budget
  * During design presentations, blind use of an example presentation (even including nicknames for team members just because a team did that before)
  
I understand the need to learn the thought process used by engineers to do design work, but the emphasis here is solely on PROCESS and any THOUGHT is generally accidental.
